# Machine-Learning
The following project implies running several machine learning models over the well known Iris dataset and the California Housing dataset.
This models are fined-tuned to combat overfitting running hyper-parameters with gridsearch and cross folds.
The machine learning models trained for predicion includes:
-Decison Tree
-Random Forest
-Adaboost
-Gradient Boosting

Acuracies are displayed for comparison.
