# Machine-Learning

Please find the Jupyter Notebooks on top for these projects:



## Ensemble Learning <br />
The following project implies running several machine learning models over a synthetic moon dataset.
This models are fined-tuned to combat overfitting running hyper-parameters with gridsearch and cross folds.
The machine learning models trained for predicion includes:
-Decison Tree <br />
-Random Forest <br />
-Adaboost <br />
-Gradient Boosting <br />
Acuracies are displayed for comparison.

## Clustering <br />
In this project I segmented customers into different groups based on their shopping trends, classified papers, and build an image compressor with K-means.
